## Hi! 

My name is Radosław Białek, and I'm a Java & Kotlin Android developer from Poland. I create applications for the glory of God and the benefit of people.

I have released 4 Android apps in Google Play (available in English and Polish):
* [Book of Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.ksiegazycia)
* [Glory for Ever](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.chwalanawieki)
* [Divine Consolation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.boskiepocieszenie)
* [Jesus Mary Joseph](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.jezusmaryjajozef)

The above apps are closed-source at the moment, and this GitHub account I use mainly for some tutorial-based apps for my reference. 

But besides mobile development, I also like JavaScript and under this respect I created Divine Consolation as a simplified web app which is available at [DivineConsolation.com](https://divineconsolation.com/).

My another website is [PrawdziwaWiara.pl](https://prawdziwawiara.pl/) (in Polish only) which in simple form describes the current apostasy in Vatican which started with John XXIII becoming an Anti-Pope in 1958 and the Second Vatican Council held in 1962-1965. Francis in not a true Pope, but a modernist heretic. For more information in English, I recommend [VaticanCatholic.com](https://vaticancatholic.com/).

Thanks for your visit!
