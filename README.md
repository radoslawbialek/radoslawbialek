## Hi! 

My name is Radosław Białek, and I'm a Java & Kotlin Android developer from Poland. I create Catholic applications for the glory of God and the benefit of people.

I have released 5 Android apps in Google Play (available in English and Polish):
* [Book of Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.ksiegazycia)
* [Glory for Ever](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.chwalanawieki)
* [Divine Consolation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.boskiepocieszenie)
* [Jesus Mary Joseph](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.jezusmaryjajozef)
* [Golden Chain](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.radoslawbialek.zlotylancuch)

My applications are closed-source and I don’t plan to change it. This GitHub account I use mainly for having some tutorial-based apps for my reference. 

But besides mobile development, I also like JavaScript and under this respect I created Divine Consolation as a simplified web app which is available at [DivineConsolation.com](https://divineconsolation.com/).

My another website is [PrawdziwaKatolickaWiara.pl](https://prawdziwakatolickawiara.pl/) (in Polish only) which in simple words describes the current apostasy that is happening in Vatican, and which started with John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council held in 1962-1965. Francis in not a true Pope, but a modernist heretic. For more information in English, I recommend [VaticanCatholic.com](https://vaticancatholic.com/).

Thank you for your visit!
